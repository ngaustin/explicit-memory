1. sampling
2. randomness
    1. model
    2. environment
    -> constrain the randomness.
3. gamma=0, 
    -> see the state-value closely

4. DQN
    -> Debug action values carefuly even with hands.

1. (Tae's laptop, AtLocation, Tae's desk, yesterday)
2. (Michael's laptop, AtLocation, Michael's desk, today)

1. (Tae + laptop, AtLocation, Tae + desk) + pos0
2. (Michael + laptop, AtLocation, Michael + desk) + pos1

1. 0
2. 1

5. concatenating positional vectors might be better.
